Catalyst properties:
Property name| Type| Description
Main Zeolite type| Text| The type of the Zeolite used for catalyst synthesis or its IZA code, e.g., ZSM-5, MCM-41 (material name), MFI, ITR (IZA code), etc.
Main Zeolite SiO2/Al2O3 ratio| Numeric| The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the main Zeolite used for catalyst synthesis. It is double the ratio of Si/Al ratio. Notice to differenciate them.
Secondary Zeolite type| Text| The type of the secondary Zeolite used for catalyst synthesis or its IZA code. It MUST be a type of Zeolite, NOT REGULAR CHEMICAL COMPOUND. Return this if more than one Zeolite is used for synthesis.
Secondary Zeolite SiO2/Al2O3 ratio| Numeric| The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the secondary Zeolite used for catalyst synthesis. It is double the ratio of Si/Al ratio. Return this IF ONLY MORE THAN ONE Zeolite IS USED FOR SYNTHESIS.
Main Zeolite content vs Secondary Zeolite content ratio | Text | The weight content ratio of Main Zeolite vs Secondary Zeolite, express as a:b (e.g. 50:20). Report this if more than one zeolite is used for synthesis the catalyst.
Crystallinity| Numeric| Crystallinity of the zeolite. Must be a percentage, otherwise it is not a valid crystallinity value.
Dopant substances| Dict| Doping substances of catalyst, express as {component: content}. The dopant is the substance that do not belong to Zeolite, silica or alumina. The metal and non-metal dopants should be included. Keep the unit the same expression as the text.
Final Step Calcination temperature| Numeric| Temperature used in final step calcination
Final Step Calcination time| Numeric| Duration of final step calcination
Zeolite particle diameter| Numeric| Average particle diameter of the zeolite crystals. NOT THE SIZE OF CATALYST. Is typically ranged in nm~um scale.
BET specific surface area| Numeric| Surface area measured using BET method
Total pore volume| Numeric| Total pore volume per gram of material
B/L acid ratio| Numeric| Ratio of Br?nsted to Lewis acid sites
Acidity| Numeric| Acidity per gram of material

For all above properties involving weight content, do not try to perform calculation your self. Just report as it is in the scenario text.

Testing condition/metrics:
Condition/Metric name| Type               | Description
Aromatics Feed composition                    | Dict               | Feed composition for aromatics (Benzene, xylene, ethylbenzene, etc.) with components and their values.
Reaction temperature                | Numeric            | Reaction temperature
Reaction pressure                   | Numeric            | Reaction pressure
(Weight/Volume) hourly Space velocity        | Numeric            | Feed flow rate normalized by catalyst weight or volume
H2/Hydrocarbon molar ratio          | Numeric            | Molar ratio of hydrogen vs hydrocarbon in the feed.
Ethylbenzene conversion      | Numeric            | Conversion rate of ethylbenzene, calculated as [(Moles of EB fed - Moles of EB in product) / Moles of EB fed] * 100
Xylene loss                            | Numeric            | Amount of xylene lost during the process
Xylene yield                  | Numeric            | Yield of xylene, calculated as (Moles of xylene in product / Moles of xylene in feed) * 100. Equals to 1-xylene loss.
Notice, the Xylene loss and Xylene yield are sum up to 100% and converted to each other theoretically. But you need only report the one showed in the scenario text, do not try to calculate the other one your self.
PX Selectivity          | Numeric            | Selectivity for p-xylene, also called xylene isomerization rate, calculated as Moles/Weight fraction of p-xylene in product(Fraction in all xylene).
PX Equilibrium achieve rate | Numeric            | Equilibrium achieve rate of p-xylene, calculated as (Moles of p-xylene in product / Moles of p-xylene should be in equilibrium) * 100
Product composition | Dict            | Product composition. If outlet composition is explicitly given, output composition with components and their values. If not, do not return this column.
